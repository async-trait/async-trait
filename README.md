# I *<ins>am</ins>* versatility! 🛠️
Programming is an art form, everything is interesting.

## I've explored (and am still actively researching):
- Reverse engineering 🎭 (Primarily on **Windows** and in x86-64, but fundamentals transfer! 😊)
  - Windows APIs!
- Web development 🌐 (Primarily [**React ⚛️**](https://react.dev) but my love and heart lies with [**WebAssembly**](https://webassembly.org) 💜, specifically in [**Rust** 🦀](https://github.com/bytecodealliance))
- Graphics/3D Rendering 🔺 (Primarily via **[WebGPU](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html)** [implementations](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for the sake of [platform support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdMl4E7xQEY))
- Game development 🕹️ (Primarily on the [**Roblox** ⬜](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine) game engine, although less so these days since I am switching to Linux 🐧)
- Compiler/Language development (Primarily bytecode VM based)
- UI + UX Design 🖼️
- 3D Modeling ([**Blender** 🟠](https://www.blender.org))

## Programming languages
Mostly interested in Rust 🦀 these days; it's simply the most versatile language and allows for some real clean abstractions!

But, I also have extensive experience in:
- C++ 🔷 (Primarily using [**MSVC**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus), Up to [**C++20**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20.html) before I made the change to Rust)
- Lua 5.1 🌕 + [**Luau** 🟦](https://luau.org) (Very familiar with internals as well! I lived and breathed Lua's C API for a good few years!)
- [TypeScript 🟦](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [JavaScript 🟨 (ES6+)](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0) by proxy (Fun fact, also have dabbled in [roblox-ts](https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts) 😁)
